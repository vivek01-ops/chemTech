# ChemTech
ChemTech is a web application developed using Python and Streamlit that simulates chemical reactions. It leverages Google Generative AI to provide insights into various chemical processes based on user-defined inputs. The application features an interactive periodic table, detailed reaction information, and the capability to filter elements based on specific properties.


## Features
- **Benzene Reactions**: User can perform Benzene Reactions by selection name of reaction, reactants and substrate..
- **Name Reactions**: User can perform Nmae Reactions by selection name of reaction, reactants and substrate.
- **Chemical Reaction Simulation**: User can simulate reactions based on selected reactants, catalysts, and conditions.
- **Interactive Periodic Table**: Users can explore elements and filter them by group, state, electric conductivity, acidity, and more.  
- **Detailed Information**: Provides information on catalysts, mechanisms, and simulation results.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.

## Installation

To run the ChemTech application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vivek01-ops/chemtech.git
   cd chemtech
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run application:
   ```
   streamlit run Home.py
   ```

## Usage
- Open the app in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).
- Use the interactive periodic table to select reactants and substrates.
- Input any additional parameters for the reaction simulation.
- Click the 'Simulate' button to view the results.
